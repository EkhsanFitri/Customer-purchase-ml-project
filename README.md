# Customer Purchase Prediction (Python & Machine Learning Final Project)

This project analyzes a customer purchase dataset to predict purchase amounts using features such as age, gender, city, and product category. Two machine learning models (Linear Regression and Random Forest) are compared and evaluated.

## Features
- Data cleaning and exploration
- Data visualization (histograms, bar charts, scatter plots, boxplots, heatmaps)
- Machine learning modeling (Linear Regression, Random Forest)
- Model evaluation (MAE, RMSE, R²)
- Honest discussion of results and limitations

## How to Run
1. Download the dataset (`Ecommerce_Consumer_Behavior_Analysis_Data.csv`) from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or as instructed by your instructor.
2. Place the CSV file in the root of this project folder (same directory as the notebook).
3. Open the notebook in Jupyter (VS Code or Jupyter Notebook).
4. Run the notebook cells in order to reproduce the analysis and results.

## Results
Both models struggled to predict purchase amounts accurately (negative R²). Suggestions for improvement are discussed in the report.
